# BOM — Essential 1/2" Ratchet & 8–19mm Socket Set

This bill of materials lists the minimum items for a small but robust kit useful for most vehicle modifications.

Mandatory
- 1x 1/2" drive ratchet — prefer 72+ tooth mechanism, quick-release optional
- Metric sockets (shallow): 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 mm
- 1x 19mm deep socket (for wheel nuts or stud clearance)
- Extensions: 1x 3" extension, 1x 6" extension
- 1x set of heavy-duty ring/eyelet lugs (not applicable) — ignore

Recommended (nice to have)
- 1x universal joint (1/2" drive)
- 1x 1/2" breaker bar (preferably full‑length rated for high torque)
- 1x torque wrench (1/2" drive, appropriate torque range for vehicle fasteners)
- 1x 1/2" to 3/8" adapter (for use with smaller sockets)
- Storage tray or molded case to keep sockets organized

Product suggestions
- Budget/value: Tekton 1/2" ratchet + Tekton / Neiko socket sets (good value for occasional users)
- Mid-range: GEARWRENCH professional line, newer Craftsman Pro lines (balanced durability and price)
- Pro/high-end: Snap-on, MAC (premium, long warranty)

Notes on sourcing
- Prefer 6‑point sockets for high‑torque applications to reduce rounding of fasteners; 12‑point are useful in tight clearances.
- Verify socket drive size and fit; cheap sets sometimes use poorer heat treatment and will wear faster.
- If you plan to use an impact wrench, get dedicated impact sockets (not chrome plated standard sockets).
