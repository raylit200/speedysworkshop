# Essential Toolset: 1/2" Ratchet & 8–19mm Metric Socket Set

Summary
A short, practical guide to the single most valuable hand tool combination for vehicle modifications: a stout 1/2" drive ratchet plus an 8–19mm metric socket set.

Why this matters
Most automotive fasteners you’ll touch while modifying vehicles live in the 8–19mm range. A 1/2" ratchet gives you the strength, durability, and compatibility with breaker bars and extensions you’ll need.

Recommended items
- 1/2" drive ratchet — 72+ tooth, durable pawl, reversible, optional quick-release.
- Metric sockets (mm): 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (plus 19mm deep).
- Extensions: 3" and 6" (or similar).
- Optional: universal joint, 1/2" → 3/8" adapter, breaker bar, torque wrench.

Safety & usage highlights
- Seat sockets fully; use a breaker bar for stubborn fasteners; always confirm final tightening with a torque wrench where spec is required.
- Don’t use extension pipes on ratchets — use rated breaker bars.
- Wear eye protection when working on vehicles.

Care & maintenance
- Keep tools clean, lubricate ratchet pawl occasionally, inspect sockets for wear, and store in a case.
