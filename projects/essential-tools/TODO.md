# TODO — Essential Tools project

Small tasks to complete the project page and make it a useful reference.

- [ ] Add photos of a recommended kit (ratchet, sockets, extensions)
- [ ] Add links to three recommended product examples (budget, mid-range, pro)
- [ ] Add short 30s how-to GIF or video demonstrating safe ratchet usage and seating a socket
- [ ] Add a maintenance checklist file (maintenance.md) with crimp/inspection tips
- [ ] Add a small table comparing 72-tooth vs 84-tooth ratchets and typical use-cases
