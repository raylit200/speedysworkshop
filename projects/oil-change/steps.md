# Steps — Oil Change (High Level)

1. Warm the engine briefly (a few minutes) to reduce oil viscosity, then turn the engine off and remove the key.
2. Park on level ground, engage the parking brake, and raise the vehicle with ramps or a jack and secure with jack stands.
3. Place an oil drain pan beneath the oil pan drain plug. Remove the drain plug and allow oil to drain fully.
4. Remove the oil filter and let remaining oil drain into the pan. Be prepared for additional oil flow.
5. Install a new drain plug washer (if required) and reinstall the drain plug to the manufacturer's torque spec.
6. Install the new oil filter (lubricate the filter gasket with a little new oil) and tighten per filter instructions.
7. Refill the engine with the correct oil type and quantity. Use the dipstick to check level.
8. Start the engine, let it idle briefly, check for leaks around the drain plug and filter, then recheck the oil level after a short run.

Notes
- Dispose of used oil and filters at a certified recycling center.
- If you are unsure about any step, consult a professional mechanic.
